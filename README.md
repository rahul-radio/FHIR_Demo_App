# IndividualProject - Diabetes Diet Planner and Tracker

## Summary
A patient's weight is a very important part of their health. Weight issues, both being over and under weight, can lead to more serious complications for a patient such as diabetes. For this reason, doctors generally tell diabetic patients to manage their weight. However, this is not a simple goal to achieve since patients are not given personalized instructions they can follow. With the FHIR standard, the Diet Planner and Tracker can use the patient's latest vital readings from any EHR system to specify the calories and macronutrient breakdown they should aim to eat. The application will also track a patientâ€™s glucose, track their weight loss progress in a visual format, project the time it will take a patient to reach their goal weight if they consistently follow the suggested diet.
